behavioral architecture worries only about how the system shoudl behave, doesn`t care about how the synthetization will be done (vhdl actually does it by itself).

data flow architecture specifies exactly how things should be synthetized (assigning bits, ANDs, ORs and etc).

type definition in vhdl -> type *name* is *type* . 

array VHDL type -> array (*range*) of *type* .
