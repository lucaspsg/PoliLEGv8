how to initialize memory from a text file

impure function init_mem return mem_type is
    file text_file : text open read_mode is "rom.dat";
    variable text_line : line;
    variable mem_content : mem_type;
    begin
    for i in 0 to 2 ** addr_s - 1 loop
        readline(text_file, text_line);
        read(text_line, mem_content(i));
    end loop;
    
    return mem_content;
end function;

pure functions -> dont change any signal values

impure functions -> change signal values

file text_file : text open read_mode is "rom.dat"; -> creates a file var and sets it on read mode

variable text_line : line; -> creates a line type var that can access lines from text_file

readline(text_file, text_line); -> reads line from text_file and assign its content to text_line
          
read(text_line, mem_content(i)); -> reads content from text_line and assigns it to mem_content(i)
